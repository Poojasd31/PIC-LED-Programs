LED Interfacing with PIC Microcontroller
LED interfacing is the simplest and most fundamental experiment while working with PIC microcontrollers. It helps in understanding how to configure I/O ports and control digital outputs.

Key Points:
LEDs are connected to PORT pins of the PIC.
Logic 1 (HIGH) or 0 (LOW) at a port pin controls the ON/OFF state of the LED.
Delay loops or hardware timers can be used to control blinking speed.
Useful for learning port direction configuration (TRIS registers) and basic embedded coding.
